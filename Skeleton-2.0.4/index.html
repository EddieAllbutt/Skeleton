            My little horse must think it queer <br>  
            To stop without a farmhouse near <br>  
            Between the woods and frozen lake <br>  
            The darkest evening of the year. <br>  
            <br>    
            He gives his harness bells a shake <br>  
            To ask if there is some mistake. <br>  
            The only other sound’s the sweep <br>  
            Of easy wind and downy flake. <br>  
            <br>    
            The woods are lovely, dark and deep, <br>  
            But I have promises to keep, <br>  
            And miles to go before I sleep, <br>
